## Lessons Learned :
During the development of the `NEWS App` project, several valuable lessons were learned that contributed to its successful completion. The journey involved overcoming challenges and making important decisions. Here are the key lessons learned throughout the project:
- **Understanding and working with APIs:** The project provided an opportunity to learn how to integrate external APIs into a Python application. Fetching data from the News API and processing it for display required understanding API documentation, making HTTP requests, and handling JSON data.
- **GUI Design:** Developing a user-friendly interface using Tkinter involved learning about different Tkinter widgets, layouts, and event handling. Designing an intuitive layout and incorporating navigation buttons required careful planning and consideration.
- **Error Handling:** Handling potential errors gracefully, such as network errors or invalid data from the API, was an essential aspect of the project. Implementing proper error handling ensured a smooth user experience and improved the overall robustness of the application.
- **Project Organization:** Managing project files, dependencies, and version control using Git was an important skill learned during the project. Organizing code into separate modules or classes helped improve code readability and maintainability.
